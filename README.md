# Algorithmic-Stock-Trading
I have used KOTAK API to trade stocks in real time. The strategy  uses bollinger bands as technical indicators to provide buy and sell signals. This framework can used to trade using any tecnical indicators that one want to including but not limited to relative strength index (RSI), Moving average convergence divergence (MACD), Exponential moving average (EMA), Fibonacci retracement.

I have used the KOTAK API"[https://www.kotaksecurities.com/offers/trading-tools/trading-api/index.html]" since it is made primarily to trade stocks in the Indian Financial Markets which was the objective of the project.
